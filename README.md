## About
It's **Shnazzy**. A complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).

## Instructions
* The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.
* The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.
* The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
